# sistema-docker
=========

Getting started
---------------


Download [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/overview). If you are on Mac or Windows, [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose) will be automatically installed. On Linux, make sure you have the latest version of [Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). If you're using [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/) on Windows 10 pro or later, you must also [switch to Linux containers](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#switch-between-windows-and-linux-containers).

Run in this directory:
```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up

```


The app will be running at [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081), and the results will be at [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081).
